#!/bin/bash			The first line that should ideally be present in a shell script. Specifies the shell interpreter to be used for the script.
				The character sequence #! is called shebang, hashbang, etc.,
chmod +x file.sh		This command grants 'executable' access to file.sh

Variable names should be ideally in uppercase and there MUST be NO SPACES before and after the assignment operator (=)
NAME="Sudershan"

$NAME				Retrieves the value stored in variable NAME
read				Command to get user input

Syntax for conditional:
if [ condition ];		MUST be spaces between the square brackets and the condition
then
	statement
else
	statement
fi

Note: The assignment operator(=) is used for condition check as well but here there MUST be space around the operator (something like $VAR = "John")

Syntax for for-loop:
for VAR in ${SOME_LIST};do
	COMMANDS
done
